## Future blog posty bit
It's finally time to take my blog off of medium and host it myself

Things I didn't like about medium:
* Paywall is a big one. It's annoying as shit personally, so why should I subject others to it?
* Code examples are annoying. I have to create a github gist, and they're not organised how I'd like

Things I need in a new solution:
* Better support for code blocks
* More flexibility in design
* Responsive
* Tags. I write about tech stuff, but I'd like to write about food more, and probably other things.
It should be possible to filter somehow by tags, so that people that only want the tech can ignore the rest.

## Usage

To run Hugo commands:

```
$ docker-compose run hugo <your command>
```
