We&rsquo;re working on a new continuous delivery platform to make developers at SEEK more efficient, and
to make our services more secure, more resilient and cheaper.</p><p>I&rsquo;m spending less time writing code lately, and a lot more time acting as a technical product manager
for our platform.
It&rsquo;s an interesting new challenge, I&rsquo;m learning a lot about what it means to be a product manager, and
I&rsquo;m really enjoying it!</p><h2 id=how-i-like-to-work>How I like to work</h2><p>More and more I&rsquo;m trying to embrace fully remote, asynchronous ways of working.
I like writing things down beacause it allows me to communicate clearly and thoughtfully.
I find it easier to express myself concisely and clearly in writing, but I also feel that writing is more durable
and easier to iterate on than verbal communication.</p><p>Earlier in my career I hated any form of planning.
Now planning is a lot of what I do.
I still like to keep things lightweight, but I&rsquo;m beginning to understand how too little planning and communication
can actually be far far worse than too much planning and communication.</p><p>I often have strong opinions, but they&rsquo;re loosley held.
I believe that being able to quickly change your mind in the face of new information is a virtue, and I tend to change
direction very quickly when this happens.</p><h3 id=types-of-documents-i-tend-to-write>Types of documents I tend to write</h3><p>I write a lot at work.
Here&rsquo;s a brief guide to some of the things I&rsquo;ve been writing a lot of lately.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll see me writing &lsquo;proposals&rsquo; or &lsquo;strategies&rsquo; when I have ideas about changes or improvements I&rsquo;d like to make to
systems and processes.
The more controversial or wide-ranging the changes, the more I feel the need to write a &lsquo;strategy&rsquo; that articulates
the multitude of problems and the common &lsquo;policies&rsquo; that we can apply to end up with a set of actions.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll see me writing &rsquo;logs&rsquo; of things (not generally what I end up calling them, but that&rsquo;s kind of what they are)
when I do something that I feel is noteworthy or otherwise might be worth documenting for the future.</p><p>I also tend to write down my ideas for how to run meetings or rituals before I&rsquo;ve actually run them.
This helps me get all of my ideas down somewhere so that I don&rsquo;t forget them, and so that I can make sure that they&rsquo;re
clearly articulated ahead of time.
I&rsquo;ll then often iterate on these by having a &rsquo;notes&rsquo; section at the bottom of the page with notes from how this meeting or
ritual went, with suggestions for how to improve the next time around.</p><h2 id=what-ive-worked-on-in-the-past>What I&rsquo;ve worked on in the past</h2><p>In the past I&rsquo;ve done a lot of Kubernetes wrangling, and I still try to keep up to date with the latest and greatest.
I&rsquo;ve done a bunch of teaching and mentoring of junior developers, and try to get involved with programs that let me
share knowledge and help people understand new concepts wherever I can.
I also studied mathematics in university, specializing in numerical methods for differential equations.
I&rsquo;m pretty rusty, but I do enjoy a math or logic problem.</p><h2 id=hobbies>Hobbies</h2><p>An ever growing list&mldr;</p><p>Food and drink is a big hobby, both eating and cooking.
Some of my adventures are on my blog, but there&rsquo;s a lot more to be discussed.
A short list of stuff I&rsquo;ve done deep dives into:</p><ul><li>Miso and shoyu (soy sauce) making</li><li>Cocktails</li><li>Carbonation</li><li>Coffee</li><li>Bread and milling your own flour</li><li>Lacto fermentation</li><li>Cured fish products (tuna bacon)</li></ul><p>I never really was a sports guy, but now I try and watch Vancouver Canucks games.
Maybe it just took a sport completely divorced from my home country and culture to get me interested?</p><p>My 3D printing is pretty rusty, but it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve tinkered with in the past and hope to again.</p><p>I like taking photos, and they usually go straight from my camera to <a href=https://www.instagram.com/nskoufis/>Instagram</a>.
This has been fantastic cure for my chronic inability to get around to editing RAWs.</p><p>I have a cute black and white tuxedo cat named Sofia who I love very much ‚ù§Ô∏è</p><hr></div></article><nav class="flex flex-col max-w-screen-sm mx-auto"><div class="flex justify-between flex-wrap pb-4"><span></span>
