## Growing tired of Medium

This has been a while coming.
To be frank, I'm sick of Medium as a content platform.

I resent the annoying full-page popups asking you to sign in.
I'm sick of these as a reader of other publications, and I'd be horrified if my readers were ever subject to them.
To add to their annoyance, I noticed a bizarre dark pattern the other day where dismissing the 'you have four articles left this month' popover caused an un-dismissable signup screen to be displayed.
If you just ignore the popup, you can read the article.
Not cool.

Aside from corporate greed, Medium isn't really built for the sort of content I tend to write.
Up until now, I've largely blogged about technical subjects.
This means lots of code snippets, which aren't as easy to integrate into Medium as I'd like.
There's no native code formatting, so I have to embed Github gists.
They work fine, but it's annoying and much more tedious than just writing code snippets inline.



Things I need in a new solution:

* Better support for code blocks
* More flexibility in design
* Responsive
* Tags. I write about tech stuff, but I'd like to write about food more, and probably other things.
It should be possible to filter somehow by tags, so that people that only want the tech can ignore the rest.
