## What I'm working on

I'm currently working as a senior staff engineer within the Engineering Platforms group at SEEK.
We're working on a new continuous delivery platform to make developers at SEEK more efficient, and
to make our services more secure, more resilient and cheaper.

I'm spending less time writing code lately, and a lot more time acting as a technical product manager
for our platform.
It's an interesting new challenge, I'm learning a lot about what it means to be a product manager, and
I'm really enjoying it!

## How I like to work

More and more I'm trying to embrace fully remote, asynchronous ways of working.
I like writing things down beacause it allows me to communicate clearly and thoughtfully.
I find it easier to express myself concisely and clearly in writing, but I also feel that writing is more durable
and easier to iterate on than verbal communication.

Earlier in my career I hated any form of planning.
Now planning is a lot of what I do.
I still like to keep things lightweight, but I'm beginning to understand how too little planning and communication
can actually be far far worse than too much planning and communication.

I often have strong opinions, but they're loosley held.
I believe that being able to quickly change your mind in the face of new information is a virtue, and I tend to change
direction very quickly when this happens.

### Types of documents I tend to write

I write a lot at work.
Here's a brief guide to some of the things I've been writing a lot of lately.

You'll see me writing 'proposals' or 'strategies' when I have ideas about changes or improvements I'd like to make to
systems and processes.
The more controversial or wide-ranging the changes, the more I feel the need to write a 'strategy' that articulates
the multitude of problems and the common 'policies' that we can apply to end up with a set of actions.

You'll see me writing 'logs' of things (not generally what I end up calling them, but that's kind of what they are)
when I do something that I feel is noteworthy or otherwise might be worth documenting for the future.

I also tend to write down my ideas for how to run meetings or rituals before I've actually run them.
This helps me get all of my ideas down somewhere so that I don't forget them, and so that I can make sure that they're
clearly articulated ahead of time.
I'll then often iterate on these by having a 'notes' section at the bottom of the page with notes from how this meeting or
ritual went, with suggestions for how to improve the next time around.

## What I've worked on in the past

In the past I've done a lot of Kubernetes wrangling, and I still try to keep up to date with the latest and greatest.
I've done a bunch of teaching and mentoring of junior developers, and try to get involved with programs that let me
share knowledge and help people understand new concepts wherever I can.
I also studied mathematics in university, specializing in numerical methods for differential equations.
I'm pretty rusty, but I do enjoy a math or logic problem.

## Hobbies

An ever growing list...

Food and drink is a big hobby, both eating and cooking.
Some of my adventures are on my blog, but there's a lot more to be discussed.
A short list of stuff I've done deep dives into:

- Miso and shoyu (soy sauce) making
- Cocktails
- Carbonation
- Coffee
- Bread and milling your own flour
- Lacto fermentation
- Cured fish products (tuna bacon)

I never really was a sports guy, but now I try and watch Vancouver Canucks games.
Maybe it just took a sport completely divorced from my home country and culture to get me interested?

My 3D printing is pretty rusty, but it's something I've tinkered with in the past and hope to again.

I like taking photos, and they usually go straight from my camera to [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nskoufis/).
This has been fantastic cure for my chronic inability to get around to editing RAWs.

I have a cute black and white tuxedo cat named Sofia who I love very much ‚ù§Ô∏è
