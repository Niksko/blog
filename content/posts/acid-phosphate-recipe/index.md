For health reasons, I've been abstaining from alcohol for the last few weeks.
This is not ideal, for obvious reasons.

That being said, we live in a time when non-alcoholic drinks are abundant,
interesting and delicious.
Increasingly, non-alcoholic drinks are being given the respect they deserve.
They're not being called by diminutive names like "mocktail".
They're not just imitations of existing alcoholic drinks, they're being used
to showcase interesting techniques and ingredients all of their own.

All of that being said, non-alcoholic drinks were popular historically as well.
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, soda had a place along-side alcohol.
Pharmacists were using sodas as a vehicle for distributing medications, as well
as other fun intoxicants like cocaine and morphine.
Instead of drunks, there were narcotic addicted soda addicts, sipping pick-me-ups
and tonics from the soda fountain of their local pharmacist.

The First World War dampened the soda industry because of shortages of sugar,
but the prohibition era helped to prolong soda's lifetime as alcohol drinkers
turned to other vices.
The Second World War also buoyed the soda industry with its alcohol shortages,
but that was about it for soda.
By the 50s and 60s, soda technology was available in restaurants and fast food
places, and medicine delivery had advanced to the point that it didn't need
soda as a vehicle any more.

For a thorough treatment of sodas, their myriad varieties, and their interesting
history, have a read of [Darcy O'Neil's *Fix the Pumps*](https://shop.artofdrink.com/product/fix-the-pumps/).
It's got hundreds of recipes for soda taken from historical sources, and it
explains all of the history, technique and ingredient information you could
ever want when it comes to soda.

Many of the recipes served as sodas survived today, but whole classes didn't.
The 'lactart' drink used lactic acid as an acidulant, and added a small amount
of cream to provide a frothy head and a creamy mouthfeel.
Other classes of soda survive, but in only one or two varieties.

An example of a drink that survives in only a few versions today is the 'phosphate'.
Phosphate drinks use a mix of phosphoric acid and salts called 'acid phosphate'
as an acidulant.
The salts act much like table salt, in that they add a moreish factor to the drinks.
The phosphoric acid gives a clean acidity to drinks, unlike acids that are fruit
derived like citric or malic acid.
The extant example of a phosphate these days is Coca Cola.
But there used to be hundreds of different phosphate drinks, and some of these
were wildly popular.

So how do we make a phosphate drink?
Well, we need to make some acid phosphate.
Once we have acid phosphate, it's as simple as picking a flavored cordial,
adding your acid phosphate, and topping off with soda water.

Darcy O'Neil will sell you [acid phosphate on his online store](https://shop.artofdrink.com/product/acid-phosphate/).
However if you're anything like me, your first instinct is that it's probably
not that hard to make some yourself.
Googling, I found a [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/6fmgnu/home_made_acid_phosphate/) which contains a recipe that's sourced from
[The Standard Manual of Soda and Other Beverages](https://books.google.com.au/books/about/The_Standard_Manual_of_Soda_and_Other_Be.html?id=kekRAAAAYAAJ&redir_esc=y).
The redditor in that thread was kind enough to convert the ancient and arcane measurements
used in the original text to modern measurements.
However there remains one issue: the measurements in the recipe are volumetric.
A lot of people own scales.
Far fewer own measurement devices capable of measuring such large quantities
of liquid.

To make home-made acid phosphate easier, I decided to buy a [graduated cylinder](https://ebay.us/Z1YaXb)
and convert the measurements from volumetric to gravimetric.

The recipe calls for phosphoric acid to be diluted with water, and then three different
mineral salts to be dissolved into this dilute phosphoric acid.
The recipe then calls for this solution to be diluted further to make up a certain volume.
Converting this to weight is relatively straight-forward.
The amounts of mineral salts are already given as weights, water has a density of about 1,
and you can figure out the density of the undiluted phosphoric acid based on MSDS sheets.
The part that seems like it would be hard or impossible to determine is what volume
is taken up by the solution of dissolved salts in the dilute phosphoric acid.
This value is dependand on the minerals in solution, as upon dissolution, it's possible
that the ions 'fit between the gaps' in the water molecules, and the resultant volume
is less than you might expect if you just added the volumes of the components together.
You're also losing carbon dioxide as a reaction byproduct when you add the salts
to the acid, so that's also going to change the volume.

Is the difference significant?
Probably not

  {{% ingredients %}}
  * 15.6 grams calcium carbonate (CaCO3 / chalk)
  * 15.6 grams magnesium carbonate (MgCO3. The one I purchased was labeled magnesium 25% carbonate. I think the 25% refers
the fact that the magnesium is 25% of the molar mass of the magnesium carbonate)
  * 15.6 grams potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3)
  * 200g 85% food grade phosphoric acid
  * water

  You should _never_ add water to acid in order to dilute it.
  Instead, you always add the acid to the water.
  The reason for this is that acid dissolution is an exothermic reaction, meaning that it generates heat.
  If you add a small amount of water to your acid, it's possible for this to generate enough heat that it boils the water,
  and this can cause acid to splash in a dangerous way.
  Adding acid to the water allows the existing volume of water to act as a heat sink, and also produces less heat.
  This isn't as much of a danger with a weak acid like phosphoric, but it's still good practice to follow chemical handling safety guidelines.
