Turns out, fig leaves have a wonderful flavor to them.
There are plenty of recipes out there for using fig leaves as a wrapping for steaming fish, meat, and rice.
But this interesting recipe (courtesy of [Lillie O'Brien's *Five Seasons of Jam*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39295501-five-seasons-of-jam))
uses this novel ingredient to make a syrup for use in drinks, cocktails and desserts.

If you've never tasted a fig leaf, you're not alone.
Take a fresh fig leaf, tear it in half, and smell.
The aroma is kind of like a green coconut.
There's a sort of sweetness to it, it's vegetal and nutty, and gives me definite tropical vibes.
Those characteristics screamed 'refreshing' to me, so I decided a summery lemonade would be a good use for the fig leaf's
unique flavor.

  * 300g water
  * 300g sugar
  {{% /ingredients %}}
  {{% method %}}
  Tear each fig leaf into a few pieces, and place them in a clean jar.
  
  Combine water and sugar in a small saucepan, and bring to a boil, stirring to ensure sugar dissolves.
  We need the high heat of the boiling syrup to extract the maximum amount of flavor from the fig leaves.
  
  Pour boiling syrup over the torn fig leaves.
  Close your jar, and leave it in a cool places for 2 weeks to allow the fig leaves to flavor the syrup.
  Over time, the syrup will take on a gentle yellow hue.
  
  After 2 weeks, strain out the fig leaves, and reserve the syrup.

This syrup is a 'simple' syrup because it has a 1:1 ratio (by mass) of sugar:water.
As such you can substitute it in most cocktail recipes that call for a simple syrup.
Below is a simple but refreshing lemonade that shows off the unique flavor of this syrup.
