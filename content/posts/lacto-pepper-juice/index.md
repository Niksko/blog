A few years ago, I was roasting peppers late at night for a recipe I was going to make the next day.
After charring the peppers in the oven, I put them in a bowl and covered them tightly with plastic wrap to make peeling
off the charred skins easier. Since it was late, I went to sleep and tended to them the next morning.

When I dragged myself out of bed, I found that the peppers had given up quite a large amount of liquid in the covered
bowl.
The liquid was sweet from the peppers, with a lovely smoky flavor from the charred skin.
It seemed a shame to waste it, so I set it aside.
After peeling the peppers and de-seeding and de-stemming them, I had a decent amount of leftover 'pepper discard'.
I must have been in a particularly zero-waste mood, because I decided to see what would happen if I lacto-fermented
this pepper discard along with the resting juices.

The result is tangy and savoury, but with some residual sweetness from the peppers, and delicious roasted pepper
smokiness. It's great in salad dressings or sauces, and could probably be reduced down to a glaze consistency for
brushing on meat or fish.

I'm particularly proud of this creation, because it was a spur-of-the-moment idea that turned out delicious.
Most of the delicious things I make are either following other people's recipes, or at the very least heavily inspired
by dishes I've eaten. It's nice to have something that I can say came straight out of my mind and onto my plate!
