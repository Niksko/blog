summary: "How to make a tangy, delicious, smoky, umami rich ferment from red peppers"
---

A few years ago, I was roasting peppers late at night for a recipe I was going to make the next day.
After charring the peppers in the oven, I put them in a bowl and covered them tightly with plastic wrap to make peeling
off the charred skins easier. Since it was late, I went to sleep and tended to them the next morning.

When I dragged myself out of bed, I found that the peppers had given up quite a large amount of liquid in the covered
bowl.
The liquid was sweet from the peppers, with a lovely smoky flavor from the charred skin.
It seemed a shame to waste it, so I set it aside.
After peeling the peppers and de-seeding and de-stemming them, I had a decent amount of leftover 'pepper discard'.
I must have been in a particularly zero-waste mood, because I decided to see what would happen if I lacto-fermented
this pepper discard along with the resting juices.

The result is tangy and savoury, but with some residual sweetness from the peppers, and delicious roasted pepper
smokiness. It's great in salad dressings or sauces, and could probably be reduced down to a glaze consistency for
brushing on meat or fish.

I'm particularly proud of this creation, because it was a spur-of-the-moment idea that turned out delicious.
Most of the delicious things I make are either following other people's recipes, or at the very least heavily inspired
by dishes I've eaten. It's nice to have something that I can say came straight out of my mind and onto my plate!

  If you know how to make roasted red peppers, you can skip this bit. If not, read on.
  
  First we need to char the peppers. If you have a gas stove, you can use that. Otherwise, an oven set to grill will
  also do a great job. A blowtorch also works, if you've got that sort of equipment.
  
  If you're using a gas stove: light one of the larger burners, and one at a time, char the peppers. Put the peppers
  right on top of the flame, and when the underside near the flame is blackened, rotate the pepper to a new side.
  Repeat with all of your peppers.
  
  If you're using an oven set to grill: let the grill preheat until it's nice and hot. Place the peppers on a foil-lined
  baking sheet or baking tray, and put them in the oven, as close to the grill elements as you can without letting the
  peppers touch the grill elements. Watch the tops of the peppers closely, and rotate the peppers when the tops are
  well blackened. Rotate until all of the sides are well charred.
  
  Once the peppers are charred all over, place all of the peppers in an appropriately sized bowl, and cover tightly
  with glad wrap. This causes the peppers to steam in their own skin, which makes it easy to peel them later. It also
  causes them to release liquid, which is what we're going to ferment.
  
  Leave the peppers until they are completely cool for maximum pepper juice.
  
  Once everything is cool, it's time to peel and seed the peppers. Again, if you're familiar with making roasted red
  peppers, you know what to do, but make sure you keep all of the seeds, skin, stem, and resting juices for the ferment.
  
  First, drain off all of the liquid that has accumulated into a separate bowl. More liquid will likely accumulate
  once you've peeled and seeded the peppers, so keep pouring off any liquid into this bowl.
  Since we covered the peppers, it should be easy to remove the skins.
  Take the peppers one at a time, rub on the skin until it peels off, and place the skin in the bowl with the resting liquids.
  Don't stress too much about getting all of it off, it'll just add a bit of smoky flavor to your peppers.
  Once you've removed all of the skin, gently pull open the peppers and remove any seeds and stem, and place those in
  the bowl with the skins and the resting liquid.
  
  Now you've got some lovely roasted red peppers. Do what you want with them. They're great marinated in some vinegar,
  oil, and garlic, or blended into sauces and dips. They'll last about a week on their own in the fridge. What this
  recipe is really interested in is that bowl full of resting liquid, skins, seeds and stem.
  
  Get a clean jar or plastic container that you've washed thoroughly, and place it on a scale.
  Add your pepper discard to your fermentation vessel and note the weight.
  Add 2% salt by weight, and mix thoroughly.
  Take plastic wrap and press it down on the surface of the ferment to keep oxygen and bugs out.
  Plastic wrap will work fine for this, but if you have fermentation weights to weigh down the solids then more power
  to you. 
  
  Place the vessel in a cool, dark spot for between one and two weeks.
  How long this ferment takes will depend on a multitude of factors, but taste regularly, and stop when the acidity,
  sweetness and saltiness are in balance.
  If you notice any fuzzy mould or yeasts collecting on the top of the ferment, scoop them away.
  
  When you're happy with the flavors of the liquid, strain through a fine mesh strainer, pressing on the solids to
  get all of the good liquid out.
  
  Refrigerate the liquid you collect and it will last about a month.
  Beyond that I've found that it starts to get alcoholic and the flavor is out of balance.
